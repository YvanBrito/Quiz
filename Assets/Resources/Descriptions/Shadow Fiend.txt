Nevermore, the Shadow Fiend, is a ranged agility hero possessing abilities that inflict superb burst damage from varying distances. Whether near or far, Shadow Fiend is able to release incredible offensive power, both physical and magical. Shadow Fiend's true power comes from the souls he takes, making him more dangerous every time he kills. With enough souls, he can release all of the captured souls in a devastating burst, dealing more damage to enemies that are closer to him. Shadow Fiend is a carry who is powerful at all stages of the game, a trait most carries don't share. He can harass and conquer the early game, gank unsuspecting heroes during the mid-stages of the game, and has huge right-click potential in the late game thanks to his passives, although his active abilities scale off by the end-game
